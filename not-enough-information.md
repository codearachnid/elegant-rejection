### Case
User has not provided enough information

### Response
Dear __(Sir or Madam)__,

It has come to our attention that you have requested __( X )__ without taking the neccessary steps to provide viable information as to the cause of your issue. I believe once this lack of responsiblity on your part is corrected we may be able to begin a useful dialog as to the resolution of the __( X )__ to your satisfaction. A prompt reply will allow context of your issue to remain in my feeble memory, which often is compared to that of a Goldfish that according to recent studies are believed to successfully retain memories for up to five months. An interesting aside to this being that if it does take you the afore mentioned five months in order to respond I may have moved on to focusing my entire attention toward another valuable individual, animal or homosapien. If in the amount of time transpired your response falls upon a time at which I am not a liberty to respond another of equal or greater skill may respond in similar manner if all requirements to the initial request are not met.

Thank you,


The undersigned.
